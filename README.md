📌 The Problem: Data Silos & Vulnerability
In the medical field, AI development faces three major roadblocks:
🔒 Privacy: HIPAA/GDPR laws prevent sharing sensitive patient images.
📉 Bias: A single hospital might only see specific patient types (Non-IID data), making local AI unreliable for others.
⚔️ Security: Decentralized networks are vulnerable to Poisoning Attacks, where a single malicious actor can sabotage the global model.
🚀 The Solution: MedFed Pro
MedFed Pro is a robust Federated Learning framework. It allows hospitals to collaborate on a "Global Diagnostic Model" without ever exchanging raw data.
🌟 Key Highlights
Privacy-First: Implementation of Differential Privacy using Gaussian noise injection.
Collaborative: Uses FedAvg to aggregate knowledge from multiple specialist institutions.
Battle-Hardened: Features a Coordinate-wise Median Aggregator to detect and neutralize malicious hackers.
🛠️ Technical Architecture: The Three Pillars
Pillar	Method	Purpose
Privacy	Differential Privacy	Prevents model inversion attacks from reconstructing patient photos.
Utility	Federated Averaging	Allows models to learn from diverse, Non-IID data distributions.
Security	Robust Median Aggregation	Ensures the model remains accurate even if 25% of the network is malicious.
📊 Experimental Results
1. The Power of Collaboration
Learning Method	Data Access	Accuracy
Local-Only	Single Hospital (Biased)	41.2%
MedFed Pro	Global Knowledge (Private)	89.8%
2. The Security Shield (Hacker Simulation)
We simulated a "Sign-Flipping" Attack where a malicious hospital tried to crash the global accuracy.
❌ Standard Aggregator: Accuracy dropped to 77.8% (Vulnerable).
✅ MedFed Robust Aggregator: Maintained 87.7% (Defended).
